\documentclass[conference]{IEEEtran}
% Some Computer Society conferences also require the compsoc mode option,
% but others use the standard conference format.
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[conference]{../sty/IEEEtran}
% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\begin{abstract}
Near Field Communication(NFC) has expanded rapidly and is set to be the new big thing in communication. Contact-less payment processing being its biggest beneficiary, there are many other uses of NFC technology like passport identification, security access etc.The growth in NFC technology does not come without any security vulnerabilities. Malicious attackers can carry out many attacks like Eavesdropping,Man in the middle attack and Relay attacks on this type of communication.Among all these types of attacks relay attack is currently not detectable and cannot be predicted in most scenarios.Relay attacks can be carried out on un-encrypted data and is much more dangerous when compared to man in the middle attack.In this paper we give an overview of security issues in NFC communication, describe the relay attack in detail, present
our timing based solution to the problem and its implementation, and give results of our
evaluation of timing based relay prevention.

\section{Introduction}
Near field communication is a type of wireless radio communication designed for a  very short range, usually up to 10 cm.It was originally based on RFID (Radio-frequency identification) and operates at 13.56 MHz communicating very small amounts of data, at rates between 106 and 424 kbps. NFC is primarily designed for communication between a tag and a reader using these radio frequency waves. When NFC is used for communication of secure and confidential data, security is always going to be an issue that has to be dealt with priority.Secure transactions, such as financial, the need for security is even higher. Credit card in its natural form is prone to fraud and is rapidly moving to a contact-less medium for conducting business which adds more complexity. The security of NFC is a significant concern and as the use of this technology grows, that concern grows with it.One of the inherent security structures built into NFC technology is the proximity for communication.Because tags are only able to communicate over about 10 cm eavesdropping on the communication can prove to be challenging. It has previously been shown that distance can actually be increased to at least 50 cm. While any attack involving the transfer of secure information is a concern, the relay attack is one of the most critical because there is not a lot of hardware that is required to carry out this attack and the user would not have an idea when the attack takes place. 
\section{Relay attacks on NFC Communication}
The intruder launches a relay episode by putting a malicious reader close to the label owners genuine label and a malicious tag close to the genuine reader. The malicious tag as well as the malicious reader are connected as well as form an url to pass all activity forth and back between the authentic tag as well as authentic reader. The relay may be attached over any medium including the Bluetooth or Internet, and all visitors in between the genuine tag and genuine reader is transferred straight to the opposite end. Figure 1.3 illustrates a relay strike. Right here we are able to observe the malicious tag C comes into selection of the authentic reader D what requests communication. This particular request is passed from the relay
to the malicious person B as well as the petition is created to the genuine tag A. Tag A responds and that information is transferred again throughout the link on the authentic reader D. The authentic tag as well as authentic reader both believe they're speaking directly to the genuine unit in close proximity. This particular confidence of proximity is bypassed by the relay, and the inherent security feature breaks. Since tags are made to be activated with no user interaction they're especially susceptible to this particular attack. A
malicious party may just provide one end of the relay of theirs up to a geniune label while it's in a pocket or perhaps a bag.
\section{Existing work}
Several of the more promising work done in relay attack prevention use distance bounding protocols, which set an upper bound to the distances allowed. This
is actually attained by requiring a cryptographic challenge response mechanism to measure the proximity to the authentic device. This approach is able to present challenges, such as
time for processing such responses, elimination of time extensions for responses, and dealing with noisy channels. The more error resistance is actually incorporated into them the
far more open to attacks these bounding protocols can become. A few promis-
ing work incorporates a full duplex secret key agreement scheme into the distance bounding [twenty nine]. This would hopefully help with computation and power consumption
demands as a result of the cost of cryptographic operations. Even when proper encryption
strategies are actually used the protocols still remain vulnerable to relay attacks [twenty eight].
Without authentication of the reader, an attacker could query the tag in the beginning and
replay the info at a later time, which is sometimes called terrorist fraud. Eavesdropping, or perhaps listening in on such conversations, has been identified
as a problem. Unless encryption of information is needed in some form this remains an
issue. The ECMA even state in one of their documents that users must plan
implementations carefully around possible vulnerabilities. As encryption isn't built
into NFC, security is actually left up to the application developer, or perhaps the end user of the technology, which isn't a comforting prospect. Even encryption schemes may
be ineffective without prior sharing of device authentication.
With the relay attack in case we could keep the information from the tag and send it to the proxy to emulate the tag then detection in this manner becomes impossible. There
would be no additional timing delays in such a setup. This's also not accurately
Fifteen described as a relay attack however. This's much more of a true man-in-the-middle or perhaps just
store and replay attack. This particular kind of security vulnerability has already been seen
in attacks such as ticket cloning [seven]. Even a replay attack for passport control was
discussed and is actually vulnerable, but again, this is a replay, not a relay attack.

\subsection{Countering relay attacks}
An effective countermeasure solution against the relay attack addressed here will be
an implementation that will work within the operating constraints of the existing ECMA and ISO standards. By giving a little change to the software program at the reader or
initiator we are able to in essence provide a solution with a software program or perhaps rmware update.
This wouldn't create changes to any of the existing tags, which have already been manufactured and distributed. Rather changes will remain limited to the readers,
and could produce an an easy-to-implement and ordable solution to our issue. We
don't propose a change to any of the standards, to the communication techniques or
anything to compromise alternate tag type compatibility, but rather a warning mechanism to detect and counter possible relay attempts.
This remedy has been implemented and tested with Type two Mifare Ultralight A tags. It's consistent and functional. We just used Mifare Ultralight A tags in this
project, but if alternate tag types not tested here were to present additional timing
artifacts, such as anomalies in the time readings, then at probably the worst warnings will be generated. The implementation could allow for disabling such warnings if necessary.
In a situation where those other cards types were seldom seen, the occasional warning may actually be acceptable. We will advise against allowing a system to present
warnings constantly as users could tend to be unaware and complacent when real problems occurred [twenty]. If different tag types were to be used additional research
into timing for those tags should be evaluated. We want this particular solution to be robust
against attacks and consistent in its warnings. In devices that are Android for instance a
quick code update could create the warning and veri cation system needed to protect
against relay attacks and could be pushed out to the devices as any normal software update would be.
\section{Contactless Payment System}
From new form factors like watches and phones, to new acceptance locations - like vending machines - contactless payment technology is actually fueling innovation in the payments industry. Issuers
and payment brands have introduced a variety of form factors including fobs, mini cards, stickers,
mobile phones and wearables (jewellery, wristwatches and wristbands) - all enabled with contactless payment.
As a result, consumers now view contactless as an established payment method for low value general retail transactions, ticketing and transport, and toll or perhaps parking transactions.
And contactless is actually happening on the mobile in a huge way. Already available in the US, Canada and
Australia, Apple Pay - Apple's mobile payment and digital wallet service - will soon launch in China, Hong Kong, Spain and Singapore. Apple isn't alone. Google, Samsung and others are actually looking at
extending contactless mobile payment to the users of theirs. Indeed, Samsung is actually taking things even more with
plans to extend service beyond payment to transit passes, coupons and membership cards - an approach also possible on today's multi application contactless payment cards.
\subsection{Devices in Contacless Payments}
Almost any device capable of making payments using radio frequency identification (RFID) technology is actually using contactless payment technology. The device doesn't have to be a smartphone though this's by far the most commonly used device for contactless payments. An antenna and chip embedded into the device lets the customer wave their smartphone over a card reader to create a purchase.

Security for contactless payments is actually the same as for charge card. Fraud protection laws all apply, and secure channels and encryption are actually used for sending credit card info and PIN numbers. For several purchases or high priced purchases within a very short period of time, the user is actually asked to manually enter her PIN number to ensure theft hasn't occurred. Typically contactless payments are faster because the PIN number or even a signature is not necessary. It also, nonetheless, can result in the customer to spend much more since paying is very quick and easy.

The very first example of contactless payment came in the form of Speedpass in 1997. Mobil gas stations offered contactless payment devices that clipped onto a key ring. The customer waved the device over a labeled square at the gas pump and paid instantly. Today ExxonMobil still offers this service, and other gas stations are actually incorporating contactless payment technologies into their payment choices. ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPA

% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class

% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure

% e.g., \subfloat[].


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the

% and up, which are usually not capitalized unless they are the first or
